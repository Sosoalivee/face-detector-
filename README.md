# face-detector-
A real-time face detection system using Haar Cascade and OpenCV with webcam integration. Detects faces in live video feed and highlights them using bounding rectangles.
# 👤 Real-Time Face Detection using Haar Cascades and OpenCV

This project implements a real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. It captures video from a webcam and detects human faces in each frame, drawing green rectangles around them.

## 🎯 Features

- Real-time face detection from webcam
- Uses Haar Cascade classifier (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`)
- Converts each frame to grayscale for better detection accuracy
- Highlights detected faces with bounding boxes
- Fullscreen display with adjustable window size

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sosoalivee/face-detection.git
   cd face-detection
